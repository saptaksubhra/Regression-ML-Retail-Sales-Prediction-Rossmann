ðŸ“– Introduction :

A major challenge for large retailers is to address the needs of the consumers more effectively on a local level, while maintaining the efficiencies of central distribution. As the demand for mass customization by consumers grows, methods focused on store level optimization increase in value. Prediction of sales is an important application of machine learning in the retail space. Given accurate predictions, retailers can manage dynamic pricing, staff rostering and inventory so as to maximize profit and improve the customer experience.

An accurate forecast of sales allows retail outlets to answer questions such as:

* Can we use dynamic pricing to maximize our profit?
* Do we have enough stock to satisfy demand without being overstocked?
* What are the most important factors that affect sales, and how can we optimize them?

ðŸ“– Approaches Used :

* Loading our dataset and importing all the useful libraries

* Data preprocessing and Feature Engineering

* Scaling numeric features to a (0,1) range

* Exploratory Data Analysis

* Merging of Datasets

* Encoding of categorical columns as one hot vectors

* Feature Selection

* Standardization of features

* Machine Learning Data Modeling ( For Prediction )

ðŸ“– Algorithms Used :

* Linear Regression

* Lasso Regression or L1 Regularization

* Ridge Regression or L2 Regularization

* Elastic Net Regression

* Decision Tree

* Random Forest

* XGBoost Regressor
